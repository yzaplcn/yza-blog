            <div class="blog-body">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I never thought that something I loved so much would also make me feel this <em>exposed</em>. Drawing was something I did quietly for myself, something that stayed in my sketchbooks and folders. It was comforting, familiar, and safe. But when I started sharing my art online and drawing for fandoms I cared deeply about, <em>everything changed</em>.</p>
              
                <div class="quote-box">
                    "Suddenly, art wasn’t just about creating anymore—it was about being seen."
                </div>

                <h2>From Childhood Hobby to Intentional Creation</h2>
                <p>I’ve been drawing for as long as I can remember. When I was younger, most of what I drew were original characters—many of them were projections of myself in different forms. Some were ideal versions of who I wanted to be, while others existed purely in fantasy worlds I created in my head. I drew story ideas, random scenes, and anything my imagination could come up with. Back then, drawing felt limitless, because there were <em>no expectations attached to it</em>.</p>
                <p>As I grew older, that freedom slowly disappeared. I started feeling like my art wasn’t good enough, even though people around me would sometimes tell me otherwise. Because of that, I avoided showing my work to others as much as possible. Drawing became something private again, but this time not out of comfort—<em>rather out of fear</em>. I stopped seeing it as something to enjoy and started seeing it as something I could fail at.</p>

                </a>

                <p>Around 2023, after a long period of burnout where I barely drew at all, I tried picking it up again. I noticed that even without consistent practice, my eye for art had improved. I could see mistakes more clearly, but I could also see progress. That realization pushed me to try again, slowly and carefully. Improving wasn’t easy—comparison, insecurity, and inconsistency followed me constantly—but over time, <em>I found myself enjoying drawing again</em>, this time with more intention and self-awareness.</p>

                <h2>Finding Comfort in Characters and Stories</h2>
                <p>At the start of 2025, I became more active online and started drawing fanart, particularly for <strong>Project SEKAI</strong>. I had been a Vocaloid fan for years, but what truly pulled me into the game were the characters and their stories. I started playing the game in late 2021, during the time I was at my lowest. Since the start, <em>MORE MORE JUMP!</em> became a great source of comfort for me, especially Hinomori Shizuku, who quickly became my oshi. MMJ's character stories basically saved my life, no exaggerations. Alongside her, Asahina Mafuyu and Shinonome Ena from the unit <em>Nightcord at 25:00</em> also stood out to me in ways I didn’t expect.</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    "Creating art of these characters became a way to process my own emotions..."
                </div>

                <p>Shizuku resonated with me through her quiet kindness and emotional restraint. Her struggle with pressure and the need to appear strong for others mirrored feelings I often kept to myself. Mafuyu’s story, on the other hand, reflected emotional numbness and a deep disconnect from one’s own identity—something that felt painfully familiar. Ena’s insecurity about her talent and desire for recognition struck especially close to home, particularly as someone who expresses emotions through art.</p>
                <p>Because of this, drawing them didn’t feel like just making fanart. <em>It felt like an outlet</em>. Their stories made me feel seen and understood in ways I couldn’t always explain. Creating art of these characters became a way to process my own emotions, and each piece felt like a conversation between me and the parts of myself I struggled to face. The more I drew them, the more motivated I became to keep creating.</p>

                <h2>Posting Online and Being Perceived</h2>
                <p>Sharing my art on Twitter was both exciting and terrifying. On one hand, I loved interacting with fellow fans and artists, and I even made friends through the fandom. On the other hand, posting meant opening myself up to comparison and self-doubt. Likes, retweets, and comments became numbers I pretended not to care about—but they still affected me. Sometimes, they validated me. Other times, they made me question whether my art was <em>“good enough”</em> at all.</p>

                <h2>Insecurity, Growth, and Choosing to Continue</h2>
                <p>I won’t pretend that I’ve completely overcome insecurity. Even now, there are moments when I compare myself to other artists or feel discouraged. But over time, I learned not to let those feelings control me entirely. I remind myself why I started drawing in the first place—not for numbers, not for validation, but because it helped me express emotions I couldn’t always put into words. <em>Creating fanart became a way of connecting, both with others and with myself</em>.</p>

                <div class="reflection-box">
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Art is no longer just a private comfort for me, and I’ve accepted that this comes with vulnerability. I still feel insecure sometimes, and I know that feeling may never fully go away. But I’ve also grown to understand that insecurity doesn’t mean I should stop. It simply means I care deeply about what I create. Moving forward, I want to keep drawing—not because I’m confident all the time, but because <em>art continues to give me comfort, connection, and a sense of self I don’t want to lose</em>.</p>
